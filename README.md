**HTML Django** provides syntax highlighting for the **Django Template Language**.

![Extension preview image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djch/HTMLDjango.novaextension/main/preview.png)

Firstly, this extension would not exist without this [Tree Sitter grammar created by **@interdependence**](https://github.com/interdependence/tree-sitter-htmldjango)!

I would also like to shout out [**@tommasongr**'s Ruby on Rails extension for Nova](https://github.com/nova-ruby/rails) which is excellent and has provided a lot of inspiration.

I really have no idea what I'm doing. The only other Django extensions for Nova haven't been updated since it launched so I'm trying to come up with something that will fulfill my own needs mainly.
