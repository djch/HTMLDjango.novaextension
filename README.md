<!--
ðŸ‘‹ Hello! As Nova users browse the extensions library, a good README can help them understand what your extension does, how it works, and what setup or configuration it may require.

Not every extension will need every item described below. Use your best judgement when deciding which parts to keep to provide the best experience for your new users.

ðŸ’¡ Quick Tip!Â As you edit this README template, you can preview your changes by selecting **Extensions â†’ Activate Project as Extension**, opening the Extension Library, and selecting "HTMLDjango" in the sidebar.

Let's get started!

<!--
ðŸŽˆ Include a brief description of the features your syntax extension provides. For example:
-->

**HTML Django** provides syntax highlighting for the **Django Template Language**.

<!--
ðŸŽˆ It can also be helpful to include a screenshot or GIF showing your extension in action:

Firstly, this extension would not exist without this [Tree Sitter grammar created by @interdependence](https://github.com/interdependence/tree-sitter-htmldjango)!

I would also like to shout-out to [@tommasongr's Ruby on Rails extension for Nova](https://github.com/nova-ruby/rails) which is excellent and has provided a lot of inspiration.

I really have no idea what I'm doing. The only other Django extensions for Nova haven't been updated since it launched so I'm trying to come up with something that will fulfill my own needs mainly.

ðŸ‘‹ That's it! Happy developing!

P.S. If you'd like, you can remove these comments before submitting your extension ðŸ˜‰
